yyin takes read stream and vise versa

// positive vs negative  numbers
1. + is potional
   . needs to be escaped
1 or more numbers on either side of decimal point

// identifier
2. alpabet zero or more alpha numerics

// simple vs compound
3. space followed but conjunctions
followed by space.
space means \n and \t also

// vowel vs consonent
4. first try and match the vowels
then simply any alpha bet can be 
matched for consonents

// stream changer
5.fprintf(<input-stream>,"string with access specifiers and shit",actial_variables)
. {;} // for all selectors 

// word,space,line,char count
6. anthing that is not space,newline or tab is a word
yyleng is the length of the word
\n is you know 
and [ ] would be space

// verify the arithmatic expression
with operators and shit
7. use stack to push brackets, paranthesis and brackets
on popping check weather the brackets popped are matching
// use single paranthesis everywhere
// use multi dimentional char arrays to hold 
operand and operator arrays
// yytext is something you want to hold in these 
// number of operators must be one less than that of operand

// check for valid declarations
8. TYPE LIST SC NL
// order matters
types first
id later
, ; and newline could go in any 
order after that
// you can use console for input
